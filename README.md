# Product Store üõí ‚Äì A CRUD-based MERN Product Catalog

## Overview üìñ

**Product Store** is a MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web app for managing a simple product catalog. It offers full **CRUD** functionality: users can add, view, edit, and delete products via a RESTful API. The backend uses Node.js and Express with a MongoDB database (via Mongoose), and the frontend is built with React (Vite) styled using Chakra UI. This results in a responsive, mobile-friendly UI with features like a dark/light mode toggle and toast notifications for user feedback.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Full CRUD Operations:** Add, view, update, and delete products via REST API endpoints.
* **Responsive UI:** Built with Chakra UI‚Äôs components (Flex, Grid, etc.) so the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes with a button (powered by Chakra UI‚Äôs color mode).
* **Client-side State (Zustand):** Product data is managed on the client using a Zustand store, allowing immediate UI updates after operations.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Success or error toasts notify the user after creating, updating, or deleting a product.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* **Frontend:** React.js with Vite, Chakra UI, Zustand (state management), React Router DOM (for client-side routing).

* **Deployment:** Hosted on Render.
